    <h2>How to Make Turkey Pot Pie</h2>
    <p>You'll find the full, step-by-step recipe below — but here's a brief overview of what you can expect when you make this leftover turkey pot pie:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the frozen vegetables and celery.</li>
        <li>Saute the onions in butter, then whisk in the flour and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the broth and milk to thicken the sauce.</li>
        <li>Stir in the cooked vegetables and turkey.</li>
        <li>Pour the filling into the prepared pie crust.</li>
        <li>Cover with the remaining crust and bake.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Step by Step Guide</h3>
    <b>Step 1</b>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
    <b>Step 2</b>
    <p>Place frozen peas, carrots, and beans in a saucepan with celery; add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until celery is tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.</p>
    <b>Step 3</b>
    <p>While the vegetables are simmering, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add flour, salt, pepper, celery seed, onion powder, and Italian seasoning and whisk until a paste forms, about 1 minute. Slowly whisk in chicken broth and then milk until incorporated; bring to a simmer and cook, whisking constantly, until sauce thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.</p>
    <b>Step 4</b>
    <p>Remove thickened sauce from the heat; add cooked, drained vegetables and cubed turkey and stir until filling is well combined.</p>
    <b>Step 5</b>
    <p>Set out two 9-inch pie dishes. Fit one pie pastry into the bottom of each dish. Spoon 1/2 of the pot pie filling into each dish, then lay the remaining pie pastries over top. Pinch and roll the top and bottom pastries together at the edges to seal. Use a sharp knife to cut several small slits in each top pastry to allow steam to release while cooking. Place pies on baking sheets.</p>
    <b>Step 6</b>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Check the top crusts for browning; if they are browning too quickly, cover with aluminum foil. Continue to bake until the crusts are golden brown and the filling is bubbly, 15 to 20 more minutes.</p>
    <b>Step 7</b>
    <p>Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes before serving.</p>
